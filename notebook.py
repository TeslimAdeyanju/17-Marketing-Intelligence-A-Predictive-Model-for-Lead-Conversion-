    # Lead Conversion Predictor: A Machine Learning Approach to Marketing Effectiveness

    ## üîó Link to Dataset: [Kaggle - Leads Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ashydv/leads-dataset)

    ---

    ## üìå Project Description

    This project focuses on analyzing lead behavioral patterns and evaluating the impact of different lead sources and engagement attributes on conversion outcomes. By using classification modeling, the project aims to:

    - Predict whether a lead will convert into a customer  
    - Identify high-impact features influencing conversions  
    - Score and segment leads based on their conversion likelihood  

    This tool is beneficial for marketing teams, sales strategists, and data-driven business managers seeking to optimize lead nurturing, campaign effectiveness, and customer acquisition.

    ---

    ## üìä Dataset Summary

    This project uses a real-world dataset containing lead generation and marketing interaction data from an educational services provider. Each row represents a single lead and includes categorical and numerical attributes relevant to understanding conversion behavior and lead quality.
